        <dt><strong>Newsletters and Emails</strong></dt>
        <dd>One thing that sets newsletters and customer emails apart from other types of content writing is the fact that typically your audience for these pieces of content are people who are already customers and familiar or loyal to your brand. Offering unique content that they cannot get other places can help keep their interest and make them pay attention to your emails.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Infographics</strong></dt>
        <dd>While you may not think of an infographic as a piece of content writing, the truth is that infographics are a combination of visual and written. Think about different statistics. Or interesting facts about your company or products, and use those to create infographics to distribute to your social media channels.</dd>
